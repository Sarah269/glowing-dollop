# Emissions

## Project Overview
This project looks at 2023 Greenhouse Gas Emissions data for the United States to determine where are the locations of high emissions.  Thirty-one hundred records were analyzed in Databricks using SQL.

## Insights
- Total emissions for the United States: 562,457,107 mtons CO2
- Average emissions per county: 179,012 mtons CO2
- Greenhouse Gas emissions are concentrated in the Eastern portion of the United States (midwest and east)
- Ten states account for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States
- The county that produces the most greenhouse gases is not in a top 10 state:  Maricopa, AZ
- Lower populations have higher greenhouse gas emissions
- Missouri has the highest emissions per capita, 3.5
- Thayer County, Nebraska has the highest emissions per capita, 5.95

## Recommendations
- Implement a Regional Green Industrial Corridor initiative for the top 10 states for emissions focusing on replacing coal-fired power plants.
- Pilot dense-transit urbanism for Maricopa, AZ.  Build more multi-family housing to reduce cooling footprint for individual homes. Invest in shaded "cool-pavement" walking corridors and electrified rail.
- Lobby the government to subsidize anaerobic digesters to capture methane from manure and agricultural waste and turn it into electricity.
