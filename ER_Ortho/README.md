## Results
- The average patient wait was 36-minute.
- Despite a 42% drop in patients, wait times decreased by only 5%. 
- Peak hours were 9 AM and 4 PM, though wait times were longer during non-peak hours. 
- Patient satisfaction averaged 5.1/10, highlighting areas for improvement.
- January 2023 has the highest satisfaction score, 6.4.  June has the lowest, 4.1.
- Patient volume on Saturday's is slightly higher than the rest of the week.

## Action
- Root cause analysis on patient wait time.
- Will an improvement in patient wait time improve satisfaction score?
