### Results/Findings
- Average order values decrease each year, from $47 to $43.

- Year-over-year growth for 2022 is -48.69%.
- Friday is the day with the most sales followed closely by Sunday.  
- Excelsa coffee leads in sales while Arabica has the most orders.
- Robusta lags in sales despite having orders and quantity similar to the other coffee types.
- The average unit price per product size has decreased for all sizes, with the exception of 0.2kg. 2.5kg average unit price has decreased by $1.20.
- The product sales exhibit spikes during the year, i.e., the first quarter, June, and between September and December. 
- In prior years, sales from January to February increased.  In 2022, sales for Robusta and Liberica plummeted from $1200 to $400.  Sales for Arabica and Excelsa were flat.

### Recommendations
- Review the pricing for Robusta.
- Review unit price for each coffee, roast type, and size combination.
- Investigate sales activity for 2022 to determine the cause for the reduction in sales.

### Limitations
- The data for the year 2022 only has 8 months.
