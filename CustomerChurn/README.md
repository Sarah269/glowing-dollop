# Bank Customer Churn

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn at the bank by identifying key behavioral and demographic insights associated with customers who have closed their accounts. Leveraging these insights, the project aims to develop a predictive churn model capable of estimating the likelihood of a customer leaving. This model will enable the bank to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and improve long-term engagement.
