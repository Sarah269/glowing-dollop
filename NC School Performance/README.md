### Data Source
- North Carolina school board of education

### Tools
- Excel:  Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Power BI: Dashboard

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Deleted rows for schools that did not have any data
- Removed colummns with incomplete data
- Replaced "<95" with 96
- Replaced "<5" with 5
- Created new column School Type
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Total schools
- Total public schools
- Total charter schools
- Number of schools in each local education agency
- Local education agencies with the most/least schools
- Average SPG, EVAAS, and Achievement scores by region
- Average SPG, EVAAS, and Achievement scores by school type

### Power BI
- Created three measures:  Number of Public schools, Number of Charter schools, Count of schools with achievement scores >= 85
  
### Results/Findings
 - After data cleaning there are 2407 schools, 2286 public & 121 charter.
 - Average achievement score was 58 (grade: C).
 - Average EVAAS (Education Value-added assessment) score was 78 (grade: B).
 - Average SPG (School Performance Grade) was 62 (grade: C).
 - North Carolina school board of education has nine regions.
 - Wake forest county has 166 schools while smaller counties have 1-3 schools.
 - Performance acrosss regions was uniform.
 - All regions did well in making progress from the previous year.
 - A small group of 111 schools had achievement scores greater than 84 (grade: A), 4.61%
 - Overall there was no significant difference between the scores for public and charter schools.
 - Regions 3,6, & 8 charter schools did better with having achievement scores >= 85.

### Recommendations
- Revise teaching methods to reflect the learning styles of today's students.  Poor end-of-grade scores seems to indicate the students are not understanding the material.
