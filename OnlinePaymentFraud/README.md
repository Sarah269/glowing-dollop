# Online Payment Fraud

## Project
Train machine learning classifiation model to detect fraud transactions

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn

## Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection

## Tasks Performed
- Load dataset
- Data preparation
- Data Visualization
- Correlation
- Encoding
- Imbalance
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model
- Predictions

## Results
- The online payment data had an imbalance of 6 million rows (No Fraud) to 8213 rows (Fraud)
- Handled the imbalance by using RandomUnderSampling to reduce the No Fraud rows.No Fraud rows were reduced to 20532 rows.
- Used hyperparameter tuning to determine the best parameters for the Decision Tree model
- The Decision Tree model achieved 97% accuracy for detecting Fraud
